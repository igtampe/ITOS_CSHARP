# ITOS_CSHARP
<b>Hey an important thing BasicRender now has its own page as a class library. This project is outdated</b>

A project I'm working on mostly to learn and practice some of the basics of C#. ITOS is a long running demo-esque thing that I've been coding since my days in Batch. This is the 4th rewrite, which like the other ones will probably not reach full completion. However, it doesn't need to. It's always been about the demo part, mostly.

ITOS is a fake operating system, but it does let me show off some of the things I can do under the programming languages I know. There were two versions in batch, one that would "crash" after logging in, and one that was more functional, allowing the user to launch a few "programs". It's probably the most functional out of the four versions.

ITOS 3 was a short-lived VB.NET implementation, and is the birthplace of BasicRender. Hence, why in AirportBoard's copy of BasicRender (BasicRender 2.3), you can see small hints of ITOS, especially with the dialog windows that are included.

ITOS 4 is mostly here to motivate me to learn a little of C#, which so far has been relatively easy. It's a good middleground between Java and VB.NET. Also, of use for anyone else who wants to use my code, ITOS_CSHARP includes a copy of BasicRenderC, which is mostly the same utility, but in C#. Included are a few more enhancements, like being able to hold DrawFiles and HiColorDrawFiles in memory, rather than reading them from disk over and over, along with a better window system, which allows for more customizable windows, thanks to its use of Window Elements. These (at least so far) include Labels, Icons for dialog boxes, Graphics (HiColor or basic), and buttons.

ITOS 4 will probably not reach much farther than the "desktop", where we can show some more windows. I was planning on implementing a "Window Manager" to make this a little more comprehensive, but I think the usefulness of this code will be a lot  better if the windows work as standalone items, rather than managed by a manager.
